## Projects 🚀

- **[FiveM Launcher](https://github.com/bdebruyn02/td-fivem-launcher)**  
  Built with Angular and Electron, this launcher enables direct connection to FiveM servers without opening the FiveM application separately. Inspired by the need for a free alternative to a paid tool, this project was my first combining Angular with Electron, which enabled system-level access to connect to user-saved servers.

- **[Online Chatting App](https://github.com/bdebruyn02/react-chatapp)**  
  A React and Firebase-based chatting app that integrates Google and Facebook login for real-time messaging. Built as a learning experience, this project deepened my understanding of React and Firebase and their applications in real-time data handling and authentication.

- **[Bundle of FiveM Scripts](https://github.com/bdebruyn02/FiveM-Scripts)**  
  This Lua-based project features a collection of scripts for FiveM servers, adding custom functionalities. It served as an excellent opportunity to expand my Lua scripting skills and delve deeper into game modding.

- **[FiveM Server](https://www.youtube.com/@originxrp5202)**  
  As the lead developer, I managed a thriving FiveM server in South Africa, attracting a community of hundreds. This experience taught me valuable skills in server hosting, configuration, and troubleshooting, along with extensive MySQL and Lua scripting experience.

- **[E-Sports Scoring](https://github.com/bdebruyn02/esports-scoring-app)**  
  Developed using Angular v17 and .NET 8 Web API with Entity Framework, this project helps manage e-sports teams, track scores, schedule matches, and calculate win ratios. The project was a rewarding challenge, particularly in integrating .NET Web API with Entity Framework for database management.
